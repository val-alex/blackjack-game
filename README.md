The purpose of this exercise is to create a simple HTML/JavaScript game of blackjack (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack).

Your game must follow the following simple set of rules:

There is a standard set of 52 cards. When the game starts, the player is given 2 random cards and the dealer is given one which the player can see. Each numbered card has its face value, the ace can be either 1 or 11 and picture cards are worth 10 points.

The player is given the following 2 options: ‘hit’ or ‘stick’. 

The player can hit or stick until they are either happy with the sum of the values of their cards or until the total of their cards add up to 21 or over. If their hand is over 21, they lose. Otherwise, if they stick, the dealer will then start drawing cards until they either have a closer total to 21. If the dealer goes over then the player wins.
